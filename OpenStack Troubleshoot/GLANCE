=================================================================================
GLANCE TROUBLESHOOTING:
=================================================================================
Glance is the code name for the OpenStack image service. This service is responsible for the functionality that allows users to discover virtual machine images, 
register new images, and retrieve existing images. Glance provides a RESTful API, which also powers the command-line interface and the image functionality in 
the Horizon Dashboard.

Glance is made up of several components. There is an API service and a registry service included in Glance. Each of these services need to be running for Glance
to work properly. Glance also requires a database such as MySQL or Postgres. Finally, Glance supports several storage backends, where images are physically stored. 
The backend you use is configurable in glance-api.conf.

1.Glance services:
====================
When troubleshooting Glance, one of the first things to check is whether or not the service is running. A quick way to confirm this is by running some simple Glance commands from the command line:

# glance image-list

When Glance operates properly, this command should return a list of images in your Glance repository, similar to the following output:

SUCCESFULLY LIST IMAGES

This command may also return an empty list if your Glance repository is empty. You may receive an error when you run this command that is similar to the following error:

" YOU MUST PROVIDE USERNAME VIA EITHER --OS-USERNAME  OR ENV_OSUSERNAME "

This error typically occurs when you haven't passed all the necessary attributes to the glance image-list command. The common way to solve this problem is by creating an openrc file that contains the attributes that are required by the command-line client. A sample openrc file would look like this:

EXPORT :USERNAME
EXPORT :PASSWORD

Once the openrc file has been sourced, you should be able to run commands such as glance image-list without the need to provide the required attributes on the command line. 
When you run the Glance image-list command and you see an error similar to the following one, you should confirm that the Glance service is running:

"Error finding address for http://127.0.0.1:9292/versions:HTTPConnectionPool(host='127.0.0.1',port=9292):Max retries exceeded with url:/versions(caused by NewConnectionError('<requests.packages.urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x7f52d3cece10>:failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 111 ] Connection reduced',))


There are a few ways in which you can verify that Glance is running. You can check for the Glance processes by running this command:

# ps –aux | grep glance-

When Glance is running successfully, you will see a process for the glance-api and glance-registry.

If you find that the glance-api and glance-registry processes are not running, you can use the glance-control tool to start them. To start all the Glance services, simply run this command:

# glance-control all start

This command will start the Glance API and the Glance Registry.



2.Confirming the Glance database:
==================================
Once you have confirmed that the Glance service has started properly, you should verify that the database is configured and operating properly.
Begin by confirming that your database engine is running. You can check whether mysql is running by executing the following command:

# service mysql status

If this command does not return a message indicating that the process is running, you will need to troubleshoot your database server to get it working properly. 
How to troubleshoot your database engine is outside the scope of this book, but there are many great resources out there that can help.

Next, you should confirm that you can connect to the database server. For example, to confirm that you can connect to MySQL, use a command similar to the following one:

# mysql -u db_user -p -h my.db.server glance 

Be sure to replace db_user with a valid username for your database and replace my_db_server with the hostname or IP address of your database. 
The last argument to this command is the database name, which in this case is glance. If you are successfully connected to MySQL, you will 
see an output similar to what is displayed here:

If you are unsuccessful when trying to connect to the database manually, be sure to verify the username and password of the database user you are utilizing. 
Once the credentials are confirmed, you should also check whether the user has appropriate privileges to access this database. With MySQL, 

you can leverage the show grants statement:

> show grants for 'glance'@'localist';

The database user for the glance database in our case is named glance. We have ensured that our glance user has all the privileges on the database, which is also named glance.

In addition to having your database engine up and running, we need to confirm that the glance database exists. In MySQL, when you run the show databases command, glance should be in the list:

>show databases;

If the glance database does not appear in the database list, then you simply need to create an empty database named glance. After confirming that the glance database 
exists, you also need to ensure that it is properly initialized. An initialized Glance database will have several tables created. You can confirm this in MySQL by 
running the show tables command in the database named glance:

> show tables;

When you run this command, if it returns an empty list, you need to initialize your glance database. This can be achieved by running the following command:

# glance-manage db_sync

This command will output several logging messages to the terminal, as it executes the database initialization. Upon completion, you should be able to run 
the show tables command again and see a list of tables similar to the preceding list.

Finally, you should confirm that the database connection string is configured properly in the glance-api.conf file located in the 127.0.0.1/glance directory. 
You can quickly view the current configuration for this connection string by running the following command:

# less /etc/glance/glance-api.conf | grep ^connection

The result of this command will be similar to the following output

connection = mysql://glance_db_user:glance_db_pass@

After this, confirm the database username and password used in the connection string. If you haven't already, follow the steps at the beginning of this section 
to connect to your database, using the same username and password indicated in your glance-api configuration file.


3.Confirming the Glance authentication:
======================================
Glance requires Keystone for its authentication. For Glance to work properly, Keystone needs to be configured and run properly. For details on troubleshooting Keystone,
refer to the previous chapter in this book. To confirm that Glance and Keystone are successfully working together, follow these steps.

Keystone up:
------------
Make sure Keystone is running. You can confirm this by running the following command:

# ps -aux | grep keystone

OutPut: should be successfully running keystone services.

If you do not see any Keystone processes running, refer to the previous chapter in this book for Keystone troubleshooting tips.


4.Service User Set Up:
======================
By convention, most OpenStack deployments will have users created for each service. In this case, it would be a Glance service user named glance. 
Confirm that this user exists by running the following command:

# openstack user list


running this command will return a list of users in Keystone. An example of the output is given in the following code:

It must be Successful

Make sure that there is a user named glance. Secondly, this user should belong to a project/tenant named service by convention. 
You can confirm that the service project exists by running the following command:

# openstack project list

In the output of this command, you should see a project named service, as demonstrated in the preceding code. The next step is to confirm that
the glance user is assigned to this project. The next command will accomplish this:

# openstack user show glance

The preceding user show command will display details for the glance user:

In the preceding project_id field, we are looking for a project ID that matches the ID of our service project displayed in the OpenStack project 
list command we ran earlier. In our example, the project ID we are looking for is 7d9cdf4b5204066b3909a3dfcb3c1d6. The output tells us that our 
glance user is indeed a part of the service project


Next, we need to confirm that the glance user has the correct roles in Keystone. The following command can help us with this:

# openstack user role list --project service glance

This command will list the roles for the glance user in the context of the service project

When examining the output of this command, we want to confirm that the glance user has the admin role in the service project.

Finally, let's confirm the password for the glance user. A quick way to confirm the password is using the OpenStack command-line client, authenticating as the glance user.
To achieve this, we will run a command similar to the following one:

# openstack --os-username glance --os-password glance --os-project-name service project list



If the password for the glance user is indeed glance, as I expect, this command will return a list of projects in Keystone:

This error tells me that the password is probably not glance, as I anticipated:

The request you have made requires authentication. (HTTP 401) (Request-ID: req-707fd197-ae15-4698-ac04-1de4c92acfe9)

At this point, I can try a few more password possibilities or I can reset the password. To reset the glance user's password, you can use a command like the following one:

# openstack user set --password-prompt glance

When you run the preceding command, you will be prompted to enter a new password for the glance user and then asked to type that password a second time to confirm. 
After you reset the password, you can test it using the same technique we described earlier

The final step is to confirm that our credentials are set properly in the glance configuration files. In both the /etc/glance/glance-api.conf and 
the /etc/glance/glance-registry.conf file, there should be a keystone_authtoken stanza. Under that stanza, if auth_plugin = password, make sure 
that the values of the username and password field match the values you have set in Keystone:

In the preceding example, our username is set to glance and our password is set to glance. Replace these values with the username and password 
you have configured for your installation.

5.Service endpoints correct:
=============================

At this stage, we should confirm that the service catalog contains the correct endpoints for the Glance service:

# openstack endpoint show glance

When you run the endpoint show command as demonstrated in the preceding line of code, you will see details for the glance endpoint in the service catalog. 
An example of a typical output is included in the following code snippet:

Confirm that the values of the adminurl, internalurl, and publicurl are correct. If any of these values are incorrect, you have the following three options to correct the issue:
•	You can use the openstack endpoint delete command to remove the current endpoints, followed by the openstack endpoint create command.
•	If you are using the default SQL driver for your service catalog, you can make the edits to the endpoints directly in the SQL database. Use caution when executing this option.
•	If you are using the templated driver for your service catalog, you simply need to update your endpoint template file.


6.Confirming the Glance API setup::
==================================
You can confirm that Glance is running as expected by testing the Glance API. This will also allow you to confirm that Glance and Keystone are correctly configured to work together. To begin, you can request an Auth Token using the Keystone API and your glance service user. If you have any trouble with getting Keystone to run successfully, refer to Chapter 2, Troubleshooting OpenStack Identity. The following CURL request will generate an auth token for the glance service user:

Make sure to modify the preceding cURL call with your glance user's password and the correct IP address or URL for your keystone installation. In the preceding example, I used glance as the password for the glance service user and localhost in the URL for my Keystone endpoint


This Curl command will return a scoped token from Keystone. The headers returned in response will be similar to the following output:

"Success result"

The Auth Token is contained in the header name X-Subject-Token. We will use this Auth Token when we query the Glance API to confirm that it is working properly. To test the Glance API, we send a request to list the images in Glance:

This API request will return a response that is similar to the following one:

"Success outPut"

7.Checking the command-line interface client::
=============================================

Now that we have confirmed that the API is working, we will check the command-line interface client and ensure its proper operation. We can begin by listing the images currently registered in Glance. To do this, we will leverage the openstack image list command:

User proper openers file with correct credentials or parameters

# openstack image list

# openstack --debug image list

The preceding command should print out several lines of useful information on the terminal.

A few errors that you may come across in this situation include the following:

•	Service Unavailable (HTTP 503): This could mean that your password for the glance service user is incorrect. Use the methods discussed in this section to troubleshoot that issue.
•	Unable to establish connection to http://glanceserver:9292/v2/images: This could be an indication that your Glance API service is not running. Again, you can use the information we 
        covered earlier to help you troubleshoot.

If running the OpenStack image list command does not return an error, but simply returns a blank output, this probably means that you do not have any images in your Glance installation yet.

It's also helpful to have a known working image that you can use for troubleshooting. We can install a Cirros image for this purpose. You can use the following command to download a copy of the Cirros image:

# wget http://download.cirros-cloud.net/0.3.4/cirros-0.3.4-x86_64-disk.img

Once you've downloaded the image, you can load it into Glance using the Glance command-line client:

# openstack image create --disk-format qcow2 --container-format bare --public --file cirros-0.3.4-x86_64-disk.img cirros-qcow2

Running this command will return an output similar to this:

Image Should Upload Successfully?

You can confirm that the image has been successfully loaded by executing the openstack image list command again. Once you have confirmed that the image list command is working, try a few other openstack image commands for extra assurance.



8.Glance logging and configuration:
====================================

If, after working your way through each of the preceding sections, you continue to have trouble with Glance, here are a few more elements you should check. The Glance log files will 
often contain clues that can assist with troubleshooting. You can determine the location of the Glance log files by checking the value of the log_file or log_dir setting in the Glance 
configuration file. Typically, the log files for Glance will be located in the /var/log/glance/ directory. In this directory, you should find several log files including these:

•	api.log
•	registry.log

The api.log file will likely contain a bulk of clues that you need to troubleshoot Glance. It's also worth reminding you that Glance leverages Keystone for authentication. Therefore, in addition to the Glance logs, you will want to keep an eye on the Keystone logs. Similar to the Glance logs, the Keystone logs are typically located at /var/log/keystone. Refer to Chapter 2, Troubleshooting OpenStack Identity, for more details.

9.The log level:
=================
When troubleshooting OpenStack, it is helpful to increase the logging level so that more information is printed on the logs. This additional information can help provide more insight into how the system is operating and may help you isolate the source of problems. To turn on debug logging for Glance, you need to modify /etc/glance/glance-api.conf. In this configuration file, there is a setting named debug and is usually located under the From oslo.log section. To turn on debugging, simply set debug = true.

10.Where to look:
=================
When troubleshooting Glance, it makes sense to start by looking in the Glance logs. However, remember that Glance is interconnected with other OpenStack projects. This means that the root of the problem I am troubleshooting may not be in Glance at all. Therefore, I recommend that you look for log files that have been recently modified. One way to accomplish this is using the find command to list log files that have been modified in the last 5 minutes. For example, you can run the following command from the /var/log directory to do so:

# find . -iname "*.log" -mmin -1 -printf '%T+ %p\n' | sort -r

Using this command will help you see which log files you may want to investigate for clues.

11.Searching logs:
===================
Again, when troubleshooting Glance, we should start with the Glance log files and then potentially investigate some of the other log files returned from your find command. Once you are ready to start searching through your log files, you can leverage your standard Linux tools to look for useful information. One of the first tools I pick up is the tail command. I typically begin by tailing the related log files. For example, when trying to fix a Glance issue, I will tail glance-api.log:

# tail -f /var/log/glance/api.log

Another useful tool is grep. I know grep is often seen as a solution and a problem at the same time, but I find it useful when trying to cut through the noise of the OpenStack logs and it also useful to find the useful signals that will assist with troubleshooting. For example, you can grep the log files for the words critical, error, warning, and failure:

# grep -irE 'critical|error|warning|failure' /var/log/glance/api.log

Searching the log files this way can help you quickly isolate and focus on the log lines that provide key information for troubleshooting.


12.Common errors:
=================

In this section, we will explore a few of the more common errors we may come across in the Glance log files. The different errors you may come across are varied, and part of the troubleshooter's job is tracking down the root cause of those errors.

Unable to establish connection:
===============================
When using the OpenStack client to execute Glance-related commands, you can come across a connection error similar to the following one:

#####ERROR############

this typically indicates a configuration problem wherein Keystone is not accessible at the provided URI. When using the Glance client, this value is typically pulled from the OS_AUTH_URL value in the openrc file. Refer to Chapter 2, Troubleshooting OpenStack Identity, for information about the openrc file. You can find yourself in this situation when the value of your os_auth_url is incorrect. Alternately, this could also be the result of Keystone not running on the expected URI and port. To correct this issue, you will need to update your openrc file with the correct os_auth_url or pass the correct value in as an attribute to your OpenStack CLI commands.

Internal server errors (HTTP 500):
==================================
Internal server errors in OpenStack can be tricky because there are several factors that may contribute to these problems. In the context of Glance, if you see an error similar to this, be sure to check the database, making sure that it is running and configured correctly:

"Internal Server Error (HTTP 500) (Request-ID: req-111.222.333)"

Unable to validate token:
==========================
When you are searching through your logs, if you come across an error like the following one, this is a clue that there is a problem with the configuration between Glance and Keystone:

"CRITICAL Keystonemiddleware.auth_token [-] Unable to validate token"

If you come across an error like the preceding error, take a look at the /var/log/glance/api.log file. Near this error, look out for a log line similar to the following one:

"Discoveryfailure: Could not determine a suitable URL for the plugin"
 
This error points to the need to confirm your auth_url setting in the glance-api.conf file. The value for this setting should be the URL for your Keystone installation that is accessed on port 35357.
