CHAPTER-4:LOGGING & MONITORING:
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================
1.Monitoring a Kubernetes components:
=====================================
- How to Monitor & What to Monitor like
- such as no of nodes how many are healthy & performance metrics like- N/W,CPU,RAM,DISK utilisation.
- pod level metrics such as no o pods, performance Metrics of each pod such as CPU & Memory usage.
- We need a solution to monitor all above & store all logs
- k8's doesn't comes with build in logging feature solution
- no of open resources available.

# Metrics Server, DATA DOG, Promrthes, Elastic Stack, Dynatrace.
- Metrics Server is used as generic monitor solution.
- in memory solution can't store historic data.

2.How Monitoring Solution Works:
================================
- K8's runs on each node kubernetes & its responsible for receiving instructions from kubernetes api-server from master node & running pods on nodes.
- kubelet also have "cadvisor" component or "container advisor" its responsible for receiving performance metrics from pods & exposing  them to kubelet api to metrics available to metrics server.

To Enable metrics:
-------------------
Minikube:
---------
Minikube addons enable metrics-server

Others:
-------
#Download Libraries from GitHub------Download & Install

NodeMetrics:
------------
# kubectl top NodeName

Pod Metrics:
------------
# kubectl top pods

2.Managing Application Logs:
============================
# docker run kodekloud/event simulator.

To view container Logs:
------------------------
# docker logs -f <CID>  -----To view logs

K8's:
-----
# kubectl create -f event-simulator-pod
# kubectl logs -f event-simulator-pod. ------To view pod logs
# kubectl logs -f podsnginx/redis.      ------To view logs of container.
